## Installation Methods

Choose your preferred installation method:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Homebrew (macOS)">
    <Note>
      **Recommended for macOS users** - Homebrew will automatically install shell completions for you.
    </Note>

    ```sh
    brew install dagger/tap/container-use
    ```

    This will:
    - Install the latest `container-use` binary

    This script will:
    - Check for Docker & Git (required dependencies)
    - Detect your platform automatically
    - Install the latest `container-use` binary to your `$PATH`
