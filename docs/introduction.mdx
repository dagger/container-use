**Container Use** gives your coding agents sandboxed dev environments to work in, so they can run safely in parallel without requiring babysitting.

Container Use leverages [Dagger](https://dagger.io) for containerized workflows and Git worktrees for branching.

  <Card title="Sandboxed Environments" icon="box" iconType="duotone">
    Each agent gets a fresh container in its own git branch - run multiple agents without conflicts, experiment safely, discard failures instantly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-time Visibility" icon="eye" iconType="duotone">
    See complete command history and logs of what agents actually did, not just what they claim.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Direct Intervention" icon="helicopter" iconType="duotone">
    Drop into any agent's terminal to see their state and take control when they get stuck.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Environment Control" icon="gamepad" iconType="duotone">
    Standard git workflow - just `git checkout <branch_name>` to review any agent's work.
