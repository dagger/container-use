## What is Container Use?

**Container Use** lets each of your coding agents have their own containerized sandbox environment. Go from babysitting one agent at a time to enabling multiple agents to work safely in parallel with your preferred stack.

Container Use leverages [Dagger](https://dagger.io) for containerized workflows and Git worktrees for branching.

  <Card title="Sandboxed Environments" icon="box" iconType="duotone">
    Each agent gets a fresh container in its own git branch - run multiple agents without conflicts, experiment safely, discard failures instantly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-time Visibility" icon="eye" iconType="duotone">
    See complete command history and logs of what agents actually did, not just what they claim.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Direct Intervention" icon="helicopter" iconType="duotone">
    Drop into any agent's terminal to see their state and take control when they get stuck.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Environment Control" icon="gamepad" iconType="duotone">
    Standard git workflow - just `git checkout <branch_name>` to review any agent's work.

## Why Container Use?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scale Beyond Single Agent Workflows">
    Most coding agents require constant supervision and can only work on one task at a time. Container Use breaks this limitation by providing isolated environments where multiple agents can work simultaneously without interfering with each other.
  </Accordion>
  {" "}

  <Accordion title="Safety and Experimentation">
    Agents can experiment freely in their isolated containers with secure access to API keys, database credentials, and other secrets. Secrets are resolved within the container environment - agents can use your credentials without the AI model ever seeing the actual values. If something goes wrong, simply discard the environment and start fresh. No more worrying about agents breaking your local development setup or exposing sensitive data.
  </Accordion>
  {" "}

  <Accordion title="Universal Compatibility">
    Works with any agent, model, or infrastructure - no vendor lock-in. Container
    Use is an open-source MCP server that integrates with Claude Code, Cursor,
    VSCode, and other MCP-compatible agents.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Complete Transparency">
    Unlike black-box agent platforms, Container Use gives you full visibility into what your agents are actually doing. Every command, every file change, every process is logged and accessible.
  </Accordion>
