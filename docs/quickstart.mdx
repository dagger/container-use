## Overview

Get Container Use running with your coding agent in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through installation, agent setup, and creating your first environment.

<Note>
  Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and Git
  installed before starting.
</Note>

## Installation

Choose your preferred installation method:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Homebrew (macOS)">
    <Note>
      **Recommended for macOS users** - Homebrew will automatically install shell completions for you.
    </Note>

    ```sh
    brew install dagger/tap/container-use
    ```

    This will:
    - Install the latest `cu` binary
    - Add it to your `$PATH`
    - Install shell completions automatically

    ### Verify Installation
    ```sh
    cu version
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Shell Script (All Platforms)">
    <Note>
      **Universal installer** - Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL).
    </Note>

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagger/container-use/main/install.sh | bash
    ```

    This script will:
    - Check for Docker & Git (required dependencies)
    - Detect your platform automatically
    - Install the latest `cu` binary to your `$PATH`
    - Provide shell completion installation instructions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    ### Add MCP Configuration
    ```sh
    cd /path/to/repository
    claude mcp add container-use -- <full path to cu command> stdio
    ```

    ### Add Agent Rules (Optional)
    Save the CLAUDE.md file at the root of your repository:

    ```sh
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagger/container-use/main/rules/agent.md >> CLAUDE.md
    ```

    ### Trust Only Container Use Tools (Optional)
    For maximum security, restrict Claude Code to only use Container Use tools:

    ```sh
    claude --allowedTools mcp__container-use__environment_checkpoint,mcp__container-use__environment_create,mcp__container-use__environment_add_service,mcp__container-use__environment_file_delete,mcp__container-use__environment_file_list,mcp__container-use__environment_file_read,mcp__container-use__environment_file_write,mcp__container-use__environment_open,mcp__container-use__environment_run_cmd,mcp__container-use__environment_update
    ```

    ### Method 1: Configuration File
    Add to `~/.config/goose/config.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    extensions:
      container-use:
        name: container-use
        type: stdio
        enabled: true
        cmd: cu
        args:
        - stdio
        envs: {}
    ```

    ### Method 2: Interactive Setup
    ```sh
    goose configure
    ```
    Then add a command line extension with `cu stdio` as the command.

    ### Method 3: Goose Desktop
    Paste this URL into your browser:
    ```
    goose://extension?cmd=cu&arg=stdio&id=container-use&name=container%20use&description=use%20containers%20with%20dagger%20and%20git%20for%20isolated%20environments

  <Tab title="Other Agents">
    Container Use works with many coding agents through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

    <Card title="Complete Agent List" icon="list" href="/agent-integrations">
      See setup guides for all supported agents including Amazon Q Developer, VSCode, Cline, Qodo Gen, and more
    </Card>

    ### Quick Setup for Any Agent
    Most agents follow this pattern:

    1. **Add MCP Server**: Configure your agent to use `cu stdio` as an MCP server
    2. **Add Rules** (Optional): Download agent rules from our repository
    3. **Verify**: Ensure your agent recognizes Container Use tools

    All agents use the same MCP server command: `cu stdio`

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Your First Environment

Now let's create your first containerized environment and see Container Use in action!

### Setting Up a Demo Project

Let's start with a fresh repository:

```sh
mkdir hello
cd hello
git init
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

### Creating Your First Environment

Ask your agent to create something simple:

> Create a hello world app in python using flask

Your agent will work in an isolated environment and respond with something like:

```
[agent creates the Flask app with styling and templates]

‚úÖ The application is now running and accessible at: http://127.0.0.1:58455
üîç You can view all the files using: `cu checkout fancy-mallard`
üìã You can view the development log using: `cu log fancy-mallard`
```

Navigate to the provided URL to see your app running!

### Understanding What Happened

Notice that your local directory is still empty:

```sh
$ ls
README.md
```

This is because the agent worked in an **isolated environment**. Your local files are untouched.

### Exploring Environments

List all environments:

```sh
$ cu list
ID                 TITLE                               CREATED        UPDATED
fancy-mallard      Flask Hello World with Blue Design  2 minutes ago  1 minute ago
```

### Viewing the Development Log

See exactly what your agent did with `cu log`:

```sh
$ cu log fancy-mallard
commit 9e3a5c9debe3d3acd745c54ecfe0877626b56b7a (container-use/fancy-mallard)
Author: Your Agent <agent@container-use.dev>
Date:   Fri Jun 27 15:05:02 2025 -0700

    Write templates/index.html

    Creating the HTML template with a beautiful blue design

Notes (container-use):
    $ python app.py &

commit d94b6ab82fe36d48992e1530613c28273017f827
Author: Your Agent <agent@container-use.dev>
Date:   Fri Jun 27 15:04:47 2025 -0700

    Write app.py

    Creating the main Flask application file

Notes (container-use):
    $ mkdir -p templates
```

### Reviewing the Code

See exactly what files were created with `cu diff`:

```sh
$ cu diff fancy-mallard
diff --git a/app.py b/app.py
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..f88d1fb
--- /dev/null
+++ b/app.py
@@ -0,0 +1,10 @@
+from flask import Flask, render_template
+
+app = Flask(__name__)
+
+@app.route('/')
+def hello_world():
+    return render_template('index.html')
+
+if __name__ == '__main__':
+    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
...
```

### Exploring the Environment

#### Option 1: Check Out Locally

Bring the environment's work into your local Git workspace:

```sh
$ cu checkout fancy-mallard
Switched to branch 'cu-fancy-mallard'

$ ls
README.md  app.py  templates/
```

Now you can explore the files in your IDE, make changes, or continue development.

#### Option 2: Drop Into the Container

Get a terminal inside the exact environment your agent used:

```sh
$ cu terminal fancy-mallard

‚óè Attaching terminal
cu /workdir $ ls
app.py  templates/

cu /workdir $ python app.py
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

This gives you the same Python environment, dependencies, and setup your agent used.

### Merging the Work

Once you're satisfied with the agent's work, merge it into your main branch:

```sh
$ git checkout main
$ cu merge fancy-mallard
Updating 95bb17b..9e3a5c9
Fast-forward
 app.py           | 10 ++++++++++
 templates/index.html | 20 ++++++++++++++++++++
 2 files changed, 30 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 app.py
 create mode 100644 templates/index.html
```

## Essential Commands

Here are the key commands you'll use regularly:

```sh
# List all environments
cu list

# View what an agent did
cu log <environment-id>

# See the code changes
cu diff <environment-id>

# Check out the environment locally
cu checkout <environment-id>

# Get a terminal in the container
cu terminal <environment-id>

# Merge the work into your branch
cu merge <environment-id>
```

## Success! üéâ

You've successfully:

- ‚úÖ Installed Container Use
- ‚úÖ Configured your agent
- ‚úÖ Created your first environment
- ‚úÖ Explored the development process
- ‚úÖ Learned the essential commands

Your coding agent now has its own containerized playground. No more babysitting - let your agents work safely and independently!
