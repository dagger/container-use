## Agent Setup

Configure Container Use with your coding agent. Choose your agent below:

<Note>All agents use the same MCP server command: `container-use stdio`</Note>

<details>
<summary>üí° Command Shortcut</summary>

The `container-use` command is also available as `cu` for convenience. Both commands work identically:

- `container-use stdio` (used in documentation)
- `cu stdio` (shortcut)

</details>

<details>
<summary>üí° No Paths Required</summary>

Since `container-use` is a unique command name, you can use it directly in all configurations without specifying full paths. The command will be found automatically in your PATH after installation.

</details>

    ### Add MCP Configuration
    ```sh
    cd /path/to/repository
    claude mcp add container-use -- container-use stdio
    ```

    ### Add Agent Rules (Optional)
    Save the CLAUDE.md file at the root of your repository:

    ```sh
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagger/container-use/main/rules/agent.md >> CLAUDE.md
    ```

    ### Trust Only Container Use Tools (Optional)
    For maximum security, restrict Claude Code to only use Container Use tools:

    ```sh
    claude --allowedTools mcp__container-use__environment_checkpoint,mcp__container-use__environment_create,mcp__container-use__environment_add_service,mcp__container-use__environment_file_delete,mcp__container-use__environment_file_list,mcp__container-use__environment_file_read,mcp__container-use__environment_file_write,mcp__container-use__environment_open,mcp__container-use__environment_run_cmd,mcp__container-use__environment_update

  <Tab title="Other Agents">
    Container Use works with many coding agents through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

    <Card title="Complete Agent List" icon="list" href="/agent-integrations">
      See setup guides for all supported agents including Amazon Q Developer, VSCode, Cline, Qodo Gen, and more
    </Card>

    ### Quick Setup for Any Agent
    Most agents follow this pattern:

    1. **Add MCP Server**: Configure your agent to use `container-use stdio` as an MCP server
    2. **Add Rules** (Optional): Download agent rules from our repository
    3. **Verify**: Ensure your agent recognizes Container Use tools

    All agents use the same MCP server command: `container-use stdio`

## Your First Environment

Now let's create your first containerized environment and see Container Use in action!

<Note>
  üîí **Secret Security**: When your agent uses API keys or credentials, secrets are resolved within the container environment - agents can use your credentials without the AI model ever seeing the actual values.
</Note>

### Setting Up a Demo Project

Let's start with a fresh repository:

```sh
mkdir hello
cd hello
git init
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

### Creating Your First Environment

Ask your agent to create something simple:

> Create a hello world app in python using flask

Your agent will work in an isolated environment and respond with something like:

```
[agent creates the Flask app with styling and templates]

‚úÖ The application is now running and accessible at: http://127.0.0.1:58455
üîç You can view all the files using: `container-use checkout fancy-mallard`
üìã You can view the development log using: `container-use log fancy-mallard`
```

Navigate to the provided URL to see your app running!

### Understanding What Happened

Notice that your local directory is still empty:

```sh
$ ls
README.md
```

This is because the agent worked in an **isolated environment**. Your local files are untouched.

### Exploring Environments

List all environments:

```sh
$ container-use list
ID                 TITLE                               CREATED        UPDATED
fancy-mallard      Flask Hello World with Blue Design  2 minutes ago  1 minute ago
```

### Viewing the Development Log

See exactly what your agent did with `container-use log`:

```sh
$ container-use log fancy-mallard
9e3a5c9d  Write templates/index.html (2 minutes ago)
$ python app.py &

d94b6ab8  Write app.py (3 minutes ago)
$ mkdir -p templates
```

### Reviewing the Code

See exactly what files were created with `container-use diff`:

```sh
$ container-use diff fancy-mallard
diff --git a/app.py b/app.py
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..f88d1fb
--- /dev/null
+++ b/app.py
@@ -0,0 +1,10 @@
+from flask import Flask, render_template
+
+app = Flask(__name__)
+
+@app.route('/')
+def hello_world():
+    return render_template('index.html')
+
+if __name__ == '__main__':
+    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
...
```

### Exploring the Environment

#### Option 1: Check Out Locally

Bring the environment's work into your local Git workspace:

```sh
$ container-use checkout fancy-mallard
Switched to branch 'cu-fancy-mallard'

$ ls
README.md  app.py  templates/
```

Now you can explore the files in your IDE, make changes, or continue development.

#### Option 2: Drop Into the Container

Get a terminal inside the exact environment your agent used:

```sh
$ container-use terminal fancy-mallard

‚óè Attaching terminal
cu /workdir $ ls
app.py  templates/

cu /workdir $ python app.py
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

This gives you the same Python environment, dependencies, and setup your agent used.

### Accepting the Work

Once you're satisfied with the agent's work, you have two options to accept it:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Merge (Default)">
    Merge preserves the original commit history from the environment:

    ```sh
    $ git checkout main
    $ container-use merge fancy-mallard
    Updating 95bb17b..9e3a5c9
    Fast-forward
     app.py           | 10 ++++++++++
     templates/index.html | 20 ++++++++++++++++++++
     2 files changed, 30 insertions(+)
     create mode 100644 app.py
     create mode 100644 templates/index.html
    ```

    This maintains a complete history of the agent's work with individual commits.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Apply (Customizable)">
    Apply stages the changes for you to commit manually, discarding the original commit sequence:

    ```sh
    $ git checkout main
    $ container-use apply fancy-mallard
    Applied changes from fancy-mallard to current branch

    $ git status
    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   app.py
        new file:   templates/index.html

    $ git commit -m "Add Flask hello world application"
    ```

    This lets you review and customize the final commit before making it permanent.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Choose **merge** when you want to preserve the agent's commit history, or **apply** when you want to create your own commit message and review the changes before committing.

## Essential Commands

Here are the key commands you'll use regularly:

```sh
# List all environments
container-use list

# View what an agent did
container-use log <environment-id>

# See the code changes
container-use diff <environment-id>

# Check out the environment locally
container-use checkout <environment-id>

# Get a terminal in the container
container-use terminal <environment-id>

# Merge the work into your branch (preserves commit history)
container-use merge <environment-id>

# Apply the work as staged changes (customize commit)
container-use apply <environment-id>
```

## Success! üéâ

You've successfully:

- ‚úÖ Installed Container Use
- ‚úÖ Configured your agent
- ‚úÖ Created your first environment
- ‚úÖ Explored the development process
- ‚úÖ Learned the essential commands

Your coding agent now has its own containerized playground. No more babysitting - let your agents work safely and independently!
