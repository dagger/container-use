## Overview

Environment configuration in Container Use works in two layers:

1. **Default Configuration**: The foundation environment that all agents start from
2. **Agent Environment Adaptation**: Changes agents make to their environment during work (ephemeral until imported)

Instead of using the generic environment, you can specify exactly what base image, dependencies, and setup your project needs as defaults. Agents can then adapt their environment as they discover additional requirements during their work.

<Note>
  **Agent configuration changes are ephemeral** - they only exist within the agent's environment until you explicitly import them using `container-use config import`.
</Note>

## The Configuration Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Default Configuration">
    Configure your project's baseline environment that all agents will start from
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent Starts with Defaults">
    When an agent creates a new environment, it begins with your default configuration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent Adapts as Needed">
    During work, the agent may modify its environment configuration - adding tools, changing base images, or setting variables
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Agent Changes">
    Use `container-use config view <env>` to see what configuration changes the agent made
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import Useful Changes">
    Use `container-use config import <env>` to adopt the agent's configuration improvements as your new defaults
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Default Environment Configuration

Configure the baseline environment that all agents will start from when working on your project.

By default, environments use a basic Ubuntu image with essential tools (git, curl, ...).

### Quick Start

Set up a Python project environment:

```bash
# Set the base image to Python 3.11
container-use config base-image set python:3.11

# Add setup commands for system dependencies
container-use config setup-command add "apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential"

# Add install commands for project dependencies
container-use config install-command add "pip install -r requirements.txt"
container-use config install-command add "pip install pytest black flake8"

# Set environment variables
container-use config env set PYTHONPATH /workdir
container-use config env set DEBUG true

# View your configuration
container-use config show
```

Now all new agent environments will start with Python 3.11, your dependencies pre-installed, and environment variables configured.

## Agent Environment Adaptation

During their work, agents can modify their environment configuration when they discover they need different tools, base images, or setup commands. These changes are **ephemeral** - they only exist within the agent's environment until you explicitly import them.

Agent environment adaptation allows for:

- **Dynamic Discovery**: Agents can discover and install exactly what they need
- **Optimal Environments**: Agents can fine-tune their environment for the specific task
- **Learning Opportunities**: You can see what tools/configurations agents find useful
- **No Disruption**: Changes don't affect your defaults until you choose to import them

  Agent configuration changes are **ephemeral** - they exist only within the agent's environment. This ensures your defaults remain stable while allowing agents to experiment and adapt.

## Viewing Agent Configuration Changes

After an agent completes work, you can inspect any configuration changes it made to its environment.

### View Agent Configuration

```bash
# See the configuration for a specific environment
container-use config view fancy-mallard

# Compare with your defaults
container-use config show        # Your defaults
container-use config view fancy-mallard  # Agent's configuration
```

## Importing Agent Configurations

When an agent makes useful configuration changes, you can import them to become your new defaults for future environments.

```bash
# Import all configuration changes from an environment
container-use config import fancy-mallard

# View the updated configuration
container-use config show
```

## Base Image Configuration

The base image is the foundation of your environment - the container image that everything else builds on top of.

### Setting a Base Image

```bash
# Popular base images
container-use config base-image set python:3.11
```

### Viewing Current Base Image

```bash
container-use config base-image get
# Output: python:3.11
```

### Resetting to Default

```bash
container-use config base-image reset
# Resets to ubuntu:24.04
```

## Setup Commands

Setup commands run when creating a new environment, after pulling the base image but before copying your code. Use these for system-level dependencies and tools.

### Adding Setup Commands

```bash
container-use config setup-command add "apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential"
```

### Managing Setup Commands

```bash
# List all setup commands
container-use config setup-command list

# Remove a specific command
container-use config setup-command remove "apt-get install -y build-essential"

# Clear all setup commands
container-use config setup-command clear
```

## Install Commands

Install commands run after copying your code to the environment. Use these for project dependencies and build steps.

### Adding Install Commands

```bash
container-use config install-command add "go mod download"
container-use config install-command add "npm install"
```

### Managing Install Commands

```bash
# List all install commands
container-use config install-command list

# Remove a specific command
container-use config install-command remove "npm install"

# Clear all install commands
container-use config install-command clear
```

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are set in all new environments and can be used to configure your application, development tools, and runtime behavior.

### Setting Environment Variables

```bash
container-use config env set NODE_ENV development
```

### Managing Environment Variables

```bash
# List all environment variables
container-use config env list

# Remove a specific variable by key
container-use config env unset DEBUG

# Clear all environment variables
container-use config env clear
```

## Secrets

Secrets allow your agents to access API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive data securely. **Secrets are resolved within the container environment - agents can use your credentials without the AI model ever seeing the actual values.**

## Viewing Your Configuration

See your complete environment configuration:

```bash
# Show your default configuration
container-use config show

# Show configuration for a specific environment
container-use config show fancy-mallard

# Output in JSON format
container-use config show --json
```

Example output:

```
Base Image:            python:3.11
Workdir:               /workdir
Setup Commands:
  1.                   apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential
Install Commands:
  1.                   pip install -r requirements.txt
  2.                   pip install pytest black flake8
Environment Variables:
  1.                   PYTHONPATH=/workdir
  2.                   DEBUG=true
  3.                   LOG_LEVEL=info
```

## Configuration Storage

Your default environment configuration is stored in `.container-use/environment.json` in your project root.

<Card title="Version Control" icon="git-branch">
  **Commit your `.container-use/` directory** to share environment configuration
  with your team. Everyone will get the same environment setup.
</Card>

## Troubleshooting

If a setup command fails, the environment creation stops:

```bash
# Check what went wrong
container-use log <environment-id>

# Common fixes:
# 1. Fix the command and try again
container-use config setup-command remove "broken-command"
container-use config setup-command add "fixed-command"
```

### Configuration Not Taking Effect

Remember that configuration only applies to **new environments**:
