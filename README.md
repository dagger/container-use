**Container Use** lets coding agents do their work in parallel environments without getting in your way. Go from babysitting one agent at a time to enabling multiple agents to work safely and independently with your preferred stack. See the [full documentation](https://container-use.com).

It's an open-source MCP server that works as a CLI tool with Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible agents. Powered by [Dagger](https://dagger.io).

* 📦 **Isolated Environments**: Each agent gets a fresh container in its own git branch - run multiple agents without conflicts, experiment safely, discard failures instantly.
* 👀 **Real-time Visibility**: See complete command history and logs of what agents actually did, not just what they claim.
* 🚁 **Direct Intervention**: Drop into any agent's terminal to see their state and take control when they get stuck.
* 🎮 **Environment Control**: Standard git workflow - just `git checkout <branch_name>` to review any agent's work.
* 🌎 **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any agent, model, or infrastructure - no vendor lock-in.

## Quick Start

### Install

```sh
# macOS (recommended)
brew install dagger/tap/container-use

# All platforms
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagger/container-use/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Setup with Your Agent

Container Use works with any MCP-compatible agent. The setup is always the same: **add `container-use stdio` as an MCP server**.

**👉 [Complete setup guide for all agents (Cursor, Goose, VSCode, etc.)](https://container-use.com/quickstart)**

**Example with Claude Code:**

```sh
# Add Container Use MCP server
cd /path/to/repository
claude mcp add container-use -- container-use stdio

# Add agent rules (optional)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagger/container-use/main/rules/agent.md >> CLAUDE.md
```

<details>
<summary>💡 Command Shortcut</summary>

The `container-use` command is also available as `cu` for convenience. Both commands work identically:
- `container-use stdio` (used in documentation)
- `cu stdio` (shortcut)

</details>

### Try It

Ask your agent to create something:
> Create a hello world app in python using flask

Your agent will work in an isolated environment and give you URLs to view the app and explore the code!
